import Dispatch

/// A wrapped future that discards the result of the future. The wrapped
/// future is determined when the underlying future is determined, but it
/// is always determined with the empty tuple. In this way, it models the
/// empty "completion" of some event.
///
/// This is semantically identical to the following:
///
///     myFuture.map { _ in }
///
/// But may behave more efficiently.

    ///
    /// If the event is already completed, the function will be submitted to the
    /// queue immediately. An `upon` call is always execute asynchronously.

    ///
    /// If the event is already completed, the call returns immediately.
