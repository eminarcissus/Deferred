/// TaskAccumulator is a tool to support our *Store classes that need to
/// shut down when the user logs out. In order to shut down cleanly, we need
/// to wait for all tasks the stores may have in flight to complete so we can
/// tear down Core Data. TaskAccumulator can be given any number of tasks
/// (via accumulate()), and allCompleteTask() can be called to get a Task that
/// will be filled (with success) once all accumulated tasks have completed.
/// The success or failure of the accumulated tasks is IGNORED - TaskAccumulator
/// is only interested in completion.
